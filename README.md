# Onboarding

OH MY GOODNESS! You're here! You're really here!

How cool is that?! :sparkles: :balloon: :cake:

This is your jumping off point to get you up and running with your work in (or collaboration with) the Whitaker Lab.

(It's currently a work in progress...I really hope you can shape and improve this onboarding experience as you learn!)

## Why onboarding

You're a person! (So am I!) We're social creatures (to varying degrees.) The traditional first day practice of giving new lab members a pile of papers and say "go read these and understand them" is rather isolating. It's difficult to read scientific papers in a field you don't know, and possibly isn't the best use of your first few days and weeks.

In this repository we're going to work through some tutorials, blogging exercises, reproducing some figures from papers and....so much more :wink:.

## Your first day

* Join the Alan Turing [slack channel](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com) by asking [Charlotte](reception@turing.ac.uk) to send you an invite.
* Create a folder with your name in the [WhitakerLabProjectManagement](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/WhitakerLabProjectManagement) repository. We're going to record our weekly meetings there and use that directory to keep track of how everything is going :smile:.
  * Make a new file called `Weekly-meetings.md` in a folder with your name, eg: `Kirstie/Weekly-meetings.md`.
  * Enter `# Weekly meetings` on the top line and save the file.

## Blogging exercises

One of the most useful ways for me (Kirstie) to follow along with your progress is to read blog post summaries of what you've been working on. It's also a great way to share our work with others!

## Keep pushing

The only mandatory reading for this onboarding is [Matt Might's](http://matt.might.net/) [Illustrated Guide to a PhD](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/). It's a beautiful description of the frustration and wonder of conducting reasearch. Don't forget, whenever things are hard, ***keep pushing***.
